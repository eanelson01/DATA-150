### About me

I am orignially from Pennsylvania, an hour outside of Philidelphia. I moved to Harrisonburg, Virginia during the middle of my Sophmore year of high school. I now reside in Charllotesville, Virginia. William & Mary's campus was what most drew me to studying here in Williamsburg. As of now I intend on majoring in Neuroscience and potentially Data Science. My other interesets include American History, ranging from the founding of the nation to the Cold War era, as well as movie analyses.
